## Data visualiztion tool
This visualization tool counts the number of matching keys inside a JSON file.<br><br>

-Simply put in the url at the top, click submit and then choose which key of the JSON you would like to view.<br><br>
-The table will return a list of all unique keys as well as keys with no value assigned. Hover over the bar to see the returned count values. 

### Description of rationale for technical approach:
- I decided to used Javascript since it was the language I was somewhat familiar with. Though I had no experience in making tables or getting values from JSON files. I didn't know of any easy ways to make tables and had to hand craft them.
- I tried designing a table and a way to pull data that would always work reguardless of what JSON file was added, but because most API endpoints are tailored differently, the counting of some keypairs was useless view data. 

### Assesment of team member skills:
Jake and Matt were the only ones to work on this assignment. We scheduled times to meet and do the assignment. Ramya aparently looked at the google doc during that time since we were notified that she came online. but made no communication or contributions to the group. 
  Jake wrote the javascript. Designed the table and the data to be displayed from the repo. Matt did some styling to the table but it was removed as I had to update the table to meet new requirements and the styling was removed. <br><br>
 
As far as assesment of team skills. Matt and Jake are both proficient at making web pages as we both took 2830 but our skills were still quite limited. Ramya skill is unknown since she did not contribute.
